<settings>
	<!-- Used to support multiple resolutions of the same app. If this value exists,
	then all settings files found in the supplied folder will get applied on top of
	their base files, including engine.xml.
	OK settings-file aficionados, what this means is that, for any given setting, it
	will be a composite of potentially up to four locations. They get applied in this
	order, so later items take precedence:
	1. %APP%\settings\...
	2. C:\users\(user)\Documents\downstream\settings\(project_path)\...
	3. %APP%\settings\1920x1080\... (if the "configuration.xml:folder" setting exists, and
	its value is "1920x1080")
	4. C:\users\(user)\Documents\downstream\settings\(project_path)\1920x1080\...
	NOTE: You might think it makes more sense to have the cfg folder applied after
	the app then local settings. I do. But this order is somewhat mandated by the fact
	that we have to run the local settings to know if we have a local configuration.xml.
	
	You can add additional override settings files to the configuration folder, such as app settings, text.xml, etc 
	-->	
	<text name="folder" value="1920x1080" />	
	
</settings>
